            <h2>Introduction to Clustering</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">
                <strong>Clustering</strong> is a fundamental unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points based on their characteristics. 
                It is widely used in applications such as <strong>customer segmentation</strong>, <strong>anomaly detection</strong>, and <strong>biological data analysis</strong>. 
                In this project, clustering is applied to categorize food items based on their <strong>nutritional attributes</strong>, allowing us to uncover meaningful patterns in dietary habits.

                <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> A partition-based clustering algorithm that divides data into a predefined number of clusters.</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical Clustering:</strong> An agglomerative approach that builds a dendrogram to visualize relationships between clusters.</li>
                <li><strong>DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering):</strong> A density-based method that identifies clusters of varying shapes and detects outliers.</li>

                <li><strong>DBSCAN</strong>: Detects arbitrary-shaped clusters and handles noise but requires careful parameter tuning.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Clustering Implementation: Dataset Overview</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">
                The dataset used for clustering consists of various <strong>food items</strong> with multiple <strong>nutritional attributes</strong>, such as macronutrient composition, vitamin content, and caloric density. 
                The goal is to identify natural groupings within the dataset that reflect dietary patterns and food classifications.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Feature Selection</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                To ensure the clustering algorithms work effectively, only numerical attributes were retained. The following transformations were applied:
            </p>
    
            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li><strong>Removal of categorical attributes:</strong> Non-numeric data such as food brand names were excluded.</li>
                <li><strong>Selection of key nutritional metrics:</strong> Macronutrient composition (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and energy content were prioritized.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <!-- Data Preparation -->
            <h2>Data Preparation</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">
                Before applying clustering algorithms, the dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing. This step is critical to ensure that clustering methods operate efficiently and accurately. The preprocessing steps included:
            </p>
    
            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong> Missing numerical values were imputed using the median or mean, ensuring consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Scaling:</strong> StandardScaler was applied to normalize features, preventing attributes with larger ranges from dominating the clustering process.</li>
                <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce redundant information and optimize computation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Summary of Data Preparation</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">
                The data preprocessing steps were crucial in ensuring high-quality input for clustering. The key takeaways from this process are:
            </p>
    
            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li>All <strong>categorical variables</strong> were removed to ensure clustering algorithms work optimally.</li>
                <li><strong>Missing values</strong> were handled efficiently, preventing any data bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature scaling</strong> ensured that numerical attributes contributed equally to clustering.</li>
                <li><strong>PCA transformation</strong> helped reduce dimensionality while retaining the most important information.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p class="fade-in">
                With the dataset now optimized for clustering, we proceed to apply the K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering methods to uncover patterns in food classification.
            </p>

            <!-- K-Means Clustering -->
            <h2>K-Means Clustering</h2>

            <div class="gif-section">
                <img src="assets/k_means_clustering.gif" alt="K-Means Clustering Animation" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 20px;">
            </div>

            <p class="fade-in">
                <strong>K-Means</strong> is a widely used clustering algorithm that partitions data into a predefined number of clusters (<strong>k</strong>).
                It operates iteratively to assign data points to the nearest cluster centroid while updating the centroids until convergence. 
                The objective is to minimize intra-cluster variance, ensuring that data points within the same cluster are as similar as possible.
            </p>

            <h3>Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                Selecting the appropriate number of clusters (<strong>k</strong>) is crucial for achieving meaningful clustering. 
                A poorly chosen k-value can lead to underfitting (too few clusters) or overfitting (too many clusters). 
                To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the <strong>Silhouette Score</strong>, 
                which measures the compactness of clusters and their separation from other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates well-defined clusters.
            </p>

            <!-- Silhouette Score Graph -->

            </div>

            <p class="fade-in">
                The plot above illustrates how the silhouette score varies across different values of k. The peaks in the graph represent the most suitable choices for k, 
                as they indicate the best balance between cluster compactness and separation. Based on this analysis, the three most effective k-values were selected for clustering.
            </p>

            <h3>3D K-Means Clustering Visualization</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                After determining the optimal k-values, <strong>K-Means clustering</strong> was applied to the dataset. 
                To better visualize how the clusters are formed, we used <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong> to reduce the dataset to three principal components (PC1, PC2, PC3), 
                which allowed for a clear 3D representation of the clustering results.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                The visualization above represents K-Means clustering for three different values of k. Each color represents a distinct cluster, and the red markers indicate cluster centroids. 
                The plots highlight how increasing k influences cluster separation. Some key observations:
            </p>

            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li>For <strong>k=2</strong>, the algorithm splits the data into two large groups, which may be too broad to capture nuanced structures.</li>
                <li>For <strong>k=6</strong>, the clusters become more refined, but some smaller clusters may not have strong differentiation.</li>
                <li>For <strong>k=5</strong>, the balance between compactness and meaningful separation appears optimal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why These K Values?</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                The <strong>Silhouette Score analysis</strong> was instrumental in determining the most suitable k-values. 
                The highest peaks in the silhouette score plot indicate the values of k where clusters are <strong>most well-defined</strong> and <strong>least overlapping</strong>.
            </p>

            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li><strong>k = 2</strong>: Simpler division but lacks specificity in distinguishing different groups.</li>
                <li><strong>k = 5</strong>: Strikes a balance between cluster cohesion and interpretability.</li>
                <li><strong>k = 6</strong>: Offers more refined groupings but may introduce unnecessary complexity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="fade-in">
                These selected k-values provided the most <strong>stable and interpretable clusters</strong> while avoiding over-segmentation of the data.
            </p>

            <h3>Observations</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                The application of K-Means clustering to the dataset led to the following observations:
            </p>

            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li><strong>K-Means effectively identified meaningful patterns</strong> in the dataset, separating different food categories based on nutritional composition.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Silhouette Score guided the selection of optimal k-values</strong>, ensuring compact and well-separated clusters.</li>
                <li>Some clusters exhibit slight overlaps, indicating that alternative clustering methods like <strong>DBSCAN</strong> might be more effective in identifying varying densities.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Hierarchical Clustering -->
                <h2>Hierarchical Clustering</h2>

                <div class="gif-section">
                    <img src="assets/hierarchial.gif" alt="K-Means Clustering Animation" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 20px;">

                <p class="fade-in">
                    <strong>Hierarchical Clustering</strong> is a bottom-up clustering technique that builds a hierarchy of clusters by progressively merging smaller clusters into larger ones. 
                    Unlike K-Means, it does <strong>not require a predefined number of clusters</strong>. Instead, it generates a tree-like structure called a <strong>dendrogram</strong>, which 
                    visually represents how data points are grouped at various levels of similarity.
                </p>

                <!-- Dendrogram -->
                <h3>Dendrogram Analysis</h3>
                <p class="fade-in">
                    A <strong>dendrogram</strong> is a visual representation of the clustering hierarchy. Each point in the tree represents a cluster, and the height at which two clusters merge 
                    indicates their similarity. The higher the merge, the greater the difference between clusters.
                </p>

                <p class="fade-in">
                    The <strong>above dendrogram</strong> helps in determining the optimal number of clusters. By cutting the dendrogram at different heights, we can analyze different levels 
                    of cluster granularity. This flexibility allows us to explore relationships between food groups without a strict assumption about the number of clusters.

                <h3>3D Visualization of Hierarchical Clustering</h3>
                <p class="fade-in">
                    To better understand how hierarchical clustering grouped our dataset, we visualized the clusters using a <strong>3D PCA transformation</strong>. This allows us to observe 
                    how food items are distributed based on their nutrient compositions.
                </p>

                <p class="fade-in">
                    In the visualization above, different colors represent distinct clusters identified by hierarchical clustering. Unlike K-Means, which forces each data point into a cluster, 
                    <strong>hierarchical clustering preserves the underlying structure</strong> and allows us to observe relationships between different groups at varying levels of similarity.
                </p>

                <!-- Key Advantages -->
                <h3>Why Choose Hierarchical Clustering?</h3>
                <p class="fade-in">
                    Hierarchical Clustering offers several advantages compared to traditional clustering methods like K-Means:
                </p>

                <ul class="fade-in">
                    <li><strong>No need to predefine the number of clusters:</strong> Unlike K-Means, which requires choosing k in advance, hierarchical clustering allows us to explore the dataset naturally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Provides a complete hierarchy:</strong> The dendrogram gives a detailed visualization of how clusters are formed at different levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Works well for small to medium-sized datasets:</strong> Since it calculates all pairwise distances, it is computationally expensive for very large datasets but excellent for detailed analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identifies nested structures:</strong> It is useful when clusters have sub-clusters within them, allowing a more refined categorization.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Limitations -->
                <h3>Limitations of Hierarchical Clustering</h3>
                <p class="fade-in">
                    Despite its strengths, hierarchical clustering has some limitations:
                </p>

                <ul class="fade-in">
                    <li><strong>Computationally expensive:</strong> The algorithm has a complexity of O(nÂ²), making it inefficient for very large datasets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensitive to noise and outliers:</strong> Since it considers all data points in a distance matrix, outliers can distort the clustering structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inflexibility after clustering:</strong> Once the hierarchy is built, it cannot be modified without recalculating the entire dendrogram.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Observations -->
                <h3>Observations and Key Insights</h3>
                <p class="fade-in">
                    - Hierarchical clustering successfully captured <strong>distinct food groupings</strong> based on their nutritional attributes.  
                    - The dendrogram provided insights into <strong>nested structures</strong>, revealing how certain food types share similar characteristics at different hierarchical levels.  
                    - This method is particularly useful when we <strong>do not know the exact number of clusters</strong> in advance, allowing for a more flexible approach to categorizing food items.

                    The visualization above illustrates how <strong>DBSCAN</strong> clusters data in three-dimensional space. Unlike <strong>K-Means</strong>, which assigns every data point to a cluster, DBSCAN allows certain points to remain unclassified if they are too far from any dense cluster. These unclassified points, often labeled as "outliers," are displayed separately in the visualization.
                </p>

                <h3>DBSCAN Algorithm Parameters</h3>
                <p class="fade-in">
                    DBSCAN operates by defining two critical parameters:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Epsilon (Îµ)</strong>: The maximum distance between two points for them to be considered in the same neighborhood.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum Points (minPts)</strong>: The minimum number of points required to form a dense cluster.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p class="fade-in">
                    If a point has at least <strong>minPts</strong> neighbors within a radius of <strong>Îµ</strong>, it becomes a "core point" and expands a cluster. Points that are within <strong>Îµ</strong> distance of a core point but do not have enough neighbors to form their own cluster are considered "border points." Any point that does not fit into these categories is labeled as noise.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Advantages of DBSCAN</h3>
                <p class="fade-in">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Does not require the number of clusters to be specified</strong>, unlike K-Means.</li>
                        <li><strong>Can identify clusters of arbitrary shape</strong>, which makes it more flexible than K-Means.</li>
                        <li><strong>Effectively detects outliers</strong> as noise, reducing the impact of anomalies on clustering results.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Limitations of DBSCAN</h3>
                <p class="fade-in">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sensitive to parameter selection</strong>: The choice of Îµ and minPts can significantly impact results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Not ideal for varying-density clusters</strong>: When clusters have different densities, DBSCAN might not perform optimally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Computationally expensive for large datasets</strong>: DBSCAN has a higher time complexity compared to K-Means.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h2>Comparison of Clustering Performance</h2>
                    <p class="fade-in">
                        The <strong>Silhouette Score</strong> was used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of each clustering method. This metric measures how similar each data point is to its assigned cluster compared to other clusters. A higher <strong>Silhouette Score</strong> indicates better separation between clusters, meaning the clustering method is more effective.
                    </p>

                        The bar chart above provides a direct comparison of <strong>Silhouette Scores</strong> across the three clustering methods:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>K-Means</strong> (blue bar) achieved a moderate score, indicating that it formed well-defined clusters, but struggled slightly with irregularly shaped or overlapping clusters.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hierarchical Clustering</strong> (green bar) performed similarly to K-Means, showing strong relationships within clusters but with slightly more flexibility.</li>
                            <li><strong>DBSCAN</strong> (red bar) achieved the highest <strong>Silhouette Score</strong>, making it the <strong>best-performing method</strong> for this dataset.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="fade-in">
                        After clustering, the results were compared to the <strong>original labels</strong> stored before preprocessing. Here are key observations:

                    <ul class="fade-in">
                        <li>Some clusters strongly correspond to original food categories (e.g., high-protein foods forming a distinct cluster).</li>
                        <li>Other clusters highlight hidden relationships between certain food items that were not evident in the labeled dataset.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Key Observations</h3>
                    <p class="fade-in">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>DBSCAN</strong> outperformed the other methods, demonstrating its ability to detect clusters of varying shapes and densities while effectively handling noise and outliers.</li>
                            <li><strong>K-Means</strong> and <strong>Hierarchical Clustering</strong> produced similar scores, indicating that while both methods structured the data well, they may have struggled with non-spherical clusters or varying densities.</li>
                            <li>The high score of <strong>DBSCAN</strong> suggests that the dataset contains complex cluster structures that do not conform to the strict assumptions made by <strong>K-Means</strong> and <strong>Hierarchical Clustering</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                    <p class="fade-in">
                        Understanding <strong>food composition</strong> is crucial for making informed dietary choices. By utilizing clustering techniques, we can uncover <strong>hidden patterns</strong> within food data that provide valuable insights into <strong>nutritional similarities and differences</strong>. These insights can help in <strong>designing healthier meal plans</strong>, improving food recommendations, and identifying potentially misleading food classifications.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="fade-in">
                        The study of food clustering showcases how different items relate to one another based on their <strong>macronutrient distribution</strong>. Traditional methods of categorizing food by name or brand often fail to reflect their true nutritional composition. However, through clustering, we can <strong>identify groups of foods that share similar characteristics</strong>, regardless of how they are marketed or labeled.
                    </p>

                        Moreover, this approach enables <strong>better consumer awareness</strong>. For example, individuals looking to <strong>reduce sugar intake</strong> can use these clusters to find alternatives that match their dietary goals without being misled by branding. Similarly, athletes or those focusing on <strong>high-protein diets</strong> can identify food groups that meet their nutritional needs more effectively.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="fade-in">
                        From a broader perspective, <strong>clustering techniques in food data analysis</strong> have the potential to assist policymakers in <strong>creating better food labeling regulations</strong>, improving <strong>public health nutrition strategies</strong>, and even addressing concerns about <strong>ultra-processed food consumption</strong>. As food choices continue to evolve, <strong>data-driven methods</strong> like clustering offer a pathway to a <strong>deeper, more accurate understanding</strong> of what we consume and how it impacts our well-being.
