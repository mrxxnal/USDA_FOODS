                The data used in this project was sourced from the USDA FoodData Central API, a reliable and comprehensive repository of food and nutrient data. The decision to use USDA's database stems from its authoritative and up-to-date information on food composition, making it an ideal choice for a health analytics project. By gathering data directly from the USDA, we ensure a high level of accuracy and relevance for analyzing the impact of ultra-processed foods on public health. Health analytics is essential for uncovering critical trends and making informed decisions about dietary habits, addressing global health crises such as obesity and chronic diseases.

        <h2>How the Data Was Gathered</h2>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p>
                Data was collected using the USDA FoodData Central API, a trusted and comprehensive source of food and nutrition information. 
                The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) maintains an extensive repository of food composition data, making it a
                reliable resource for health and nutrition analytics. The **USDA FoodData Central API** provides access to various datasets, 
                including nutrient profiles, food descriptions, and product categories.
            </p>

            <div class="button-section">

            </div>

            <p>
                For programmatic access, we used the **FoodData Central API**, which allows querying foods based on categories, brand names, and 
                specific nutrient values. The core endpoint utilized for retrieving food data was:
            </p>

                <a href="https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/foods/search" target="_blank" class="github-button">Core Endpoint</a>
            </div>

            <p>
                Example of a GET request used to fetch the data:
            </p>

            <pre><code>{
                "query": "soda",
                "pageSize": 50,
                "pageNumber": 1,
                "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
            }</code></pre>

            <p>
                To ensure a diverse dataset, multiple food categories were queried, including soda, chips, cookies, candy, fast food, 
                and other ultra-processed food items. Each query was executed with pagination to retrieve a comprehensive dataset, 
                enabling deeper insights into food composition and processing levels.

        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p>
                Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data science, where we examine datasets to uncover patterns, 
                detect anomalies, and summarize key insights. In this project, EDA was carried out by creating 10 meaningful visualizations 
                to explore trends in food composition and high-calorie foods.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below is a snippet of Python code used for EDA, focusing on analyzing high-calorie food products across different brands:
            </p>

            <pre><code>import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("../data/cleaned_data.csv")

# Filter high-calorie products
df['High_Calorie'] = df['Calories_Bin'].isin(['High', 'Very High'])

# Group by Brand and compute stats
brand_stats = df.groupby('Brand').agg(
    total_products=('Calories', 'count'),
    total_high_calorie=('High_Calorie', 'sum')
).reset_index()

# Sort and limit to top 20 brands
brand_stats['proportion_high'] = brand_stats['total_high_calorie'] / brand_stats['total_products']
top_brands = brand_stats.sort_values(by='proportion_high', ascending=False).head(20)
</code></pre>

            <p>
                One of the key visualizations generated from EDA is the **Proportion of High-Calorie Products by Brand (Top 20)**, 
                which helps in understanding which brands contribute the most to high-calorie consumption.
            </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="assets/top_20_brands_high_calorie_filtered.png" alt="Top 20 High-Calorie Brands" class="topic-image">
            </div>

            <p>
                This is just one of the 10 visualizations created to uncover meaningful insights. The complete EDA process, along with 
                the remaining visualizations, can be explored in the GitHub repository below:

        <h2>Why Health Analytics Matters</h2>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p>
                Health analytics plays a pivotal role in understanding the dietary factors contributing to global health crises. By analyzing food data, we can uncover critical insights into the consumption patterns of ultra-processed foods and their association with chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions. This project is driven by the belief that data-driven insights can empower individuals, policymakers, and organizations to make informed decisions, paving the way for healthier societies and improved public health outcomes.
