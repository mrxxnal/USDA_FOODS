                The data used in this project was sourced from the USDA FoodData Central API, a reliable and comprehensive repository of food and nutrient data. The decision to use USDA's database stems from its authoritative and up-to-date information on food composition, making it an ideal choice for a health analytics project. By gathering data directly from the USDA, we ensure a high level of accuracy and relevance for analyzing the impact of ultra-processed foods on public health. Health analytics is essential for uncovering critical trends and making informed decisions about dietary habits, addressing global health crises such as obesity and chronic diseases.

            <h2>How the Data Was Gathered</h2>

            <p>
                Data was collected using the USDA FoodData Central API, a trusted and comprehensive source of food and nutrition information. 
                The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) maintains an extensive repository of food composition data, making it a
                reliable resource for health and nutrition analytics. The **USDA FoodData Central API** provides access to various datasets, 
                including nutrient profiles, food descriptions, and product categories.
            </p>

            <p>
                For programmatic access, we used the **FoodData Central API**, which allows querying foods based on categories, brand names, and 
                specific nutrient values. The core endpoint utilized for retrieving food data was:

                <p>
                    After fetching the raw data, multiple preprocessing steps were carried out to clean and transform it for analysis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong> Missing values were replaced with default values to ensure completeness. Nutritional attributes were set to zero if missing, while categorical columns like 'Brand' and 'Category' were labeled as 'Unknown' or 'Uncategorized'.</li>
                    <li><strong>Removing Duplicates:</strong> Duplicate rows were detected and removed to prevent redundancy in the dataset.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outlier Removal:</strong> Statistical techniques (Interquartile Range - IQR) were applied to detect and remove extreme outliers in key numerical features such as 'Calories', 'Protein', 'Fat', and 'Carbs'.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> New meaningful features were created, such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>**Calories per Protein, Calories per Fat, and Calories per Carb** to analyze nutritional density.</li>
                            <li>**Calories Binning (Low, Medium, High, Very High)** to categorize food items into calorie levels.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Normalization:</strong> StandardScaler was used to normalize the numerical features ('Calories', 'Protein', 'Fat', and 'Carbs') for better model performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Final Data Storage:</strong> The cleaned dataset was saved in CSV format for further analysis and visualization.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

                    <p>
                        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data science, where we examine datasets to uncover patterns, 
                        detect anomalies, and summarize key insights. In this project, EDA was carried out by creating 10 meaningful visualizations 
                        to explore trends in food composition and high-calorie foods.
                    </p>

                    <h2>All 10 visualizations can be explored in the EDA tab</h2>

                    <p>
                        Below is an image of the Python code used for EDA, focusing on analyzing high-calorie food products across different brands:

                    <p>
                        One of the key visualizations generated from EDA is the <strong>Proportion of High-Calorie Products by Brand (Top 20)</strong>, 
                        which helps in understanding which brands contribute the most to high-calorie consumption.

                    <h2>Why Health Analytics Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        Health analytics plays a pivotal role in understanding the dietary factors contributing to global health crises. By analyzing food data, we can uncover critical insights into the consumption patterns of ultra-processed foods and their association with chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions. This project is driven by the belief that data-driven insights can empower individuals, policymakers, and organizations to make informed decisions, paving the way for healthier societies and improved public health outcomes.
