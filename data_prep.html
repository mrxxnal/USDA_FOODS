                The data used in this project was sourced from the USDA FoodData Central API, a reliable and comprehensive repository of food and nutrient data. The decision to use USDA's database stems from its authoritative and up-to-date information on food composition, making it an ideal choice for a health analytics project. By gathering data directly from the USDA, we ensure a high level of accuracy and relevance for analyzing the impact of ultra-processed foods on public health. Health analytics is essential for uncovering critical trends and making informed decisions about dietary habits, addressing global health crises such as obesity and chronic diseases.

        <h2>How the Data Was Gathered</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p>
                Data was collected using the USDA FoodData Central API. This API provides access to a wealth of food-related data, including nutrient profiles, food descriptions, and categories. The core endpoint utilized was:
            </p>
            <pre><code>https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/foods/search</code></pre>
            <p>
                Example of a GET request used to fetch the data:
            </p>
            <pre><code>{
        "query": "soda",
        "pageSize": 50,
        "pageNumber": 1,
        "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }</code></pre>
            <p>
                Multiple food categories were queried, including soda, chips, cookies, candy, fast food, and other ultra-processed food items. Each query was executed with pagination to ensure a comprehensive dataset.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <h2>Raw and Cleaned Data</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p>Below are snapshots of the raw and cleaned data, providing an overview of the transformation process:</p>
    
            <div class="image-container">
                <h3>Raw Data</h3>
                <img src="assets/raw_data.jpeg" alt="Raw Data Snapshot" class="data-image">
                <p>The raw data, as retrieved from the API, contained multiple inconsistencies, such as missing values and unstructured nutrient information. This required extensive cleaning to ensure usability and accuracy for analysis.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="image-container">
                <h3>Cleaned Data</h3>
                <img src="assets/cleaned_data.jpg" alt="Cleaned Data Snapshot" class="data-image">
                <p>After cleaning, the data was structured into a consistent format with clearly defined columns for Description, Category, Brand, Calories, Protein, Fat, and Carbs. This step was crucial for ensuring reliable and accurate analysis across various models and visualizations.</p>

        <h2>Why Health Analytics Matters</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <p>
                Health analytics plays a pivotal role in understanding the dietary factors contributing to global health crises. By analyzing food data, we can uncover critical insights into the consumption patterns of ultra-processed foods and their association with chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions. This project is driven by the belief that data-driven insights can empower individuals, policymakers, and organizations to make informed decisions, paving the way for healthier societies and improved public health outcomes.
