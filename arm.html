        <h2>Unveiling Patterns with Association Rule Mining (ARM)</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">
            <strong>Association Rule Mining (ARM)</strong> is a powerful data mining technique designed to uncover hidden patterns, relationships, 
            and dependencies within large datasets. By analyzing co-occurrences of items, ARM allows businesses and researchers 
            to extract meaningful insights that can influence strategic decision-making. 
            <br><br>
            It is widely utilized in various fields, including:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Basket Analysis:</strong> Identifying items frequently bought together in retail stores.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Powering personalized product and content suggestions (e.g., Amazon, Netflix).</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud Detection:</strong> Recognizing unusual transaction patterns in banking and cybersecurity.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Diagnostics:</strong> Finding correlations between symptoms, diseases, and treatments.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">

        </div>

        <h2>Core Components of ARM</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">
            ARM operates using three fundamental statistical metrics, each playing a crucial role in determining 
            the strength and validity of associations:
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="assets/ARM_3.png" alt="ARM Metrics" class="topic-image">
        </div>

        <ul class="fade-in">
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Measures how frequently an itemset appears in the dataset. Higher support indicates greater relevance.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Represents the probability that item B is purchased when item A is bought, serving as a measure of rule reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Lift:</strong> Evaluates the strength of the association by comparing the co-occurrence of items to what would be expected by chance. A lift value greater than 1 indicates a strong positive correlation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mathematical Formulation</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">
            The following formulas define the key measures used in ARM:
        </p>

            <img src="assets/ARM_formulas.png" alt="ARM Formulas" class="topic-image">
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding Association Rules</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">
            Association rules define relationships between items in a dataset using the general form:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="fade-in">
            <strong>A → B</strong> (If A is purchased, then B is likely to be purchased)
        </blockquote>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="assets/ARM_association.png" alt="ARM Association Rules" class="topic-image">
        </div>

        <p class="fade-in">
            <strong>Example:</strong>  
            Consider a supermarket scenario where the system detects the following pattern:  
            <br>
            Customers who purchase <strong>milk and bread</strong> frequently buy <strong>butter</strong> as well.  
            <br>
            This results in the association rule:  
            <strong>{Milk, Bread} → {Butter}</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>The Apriori Algorithm: Mining Strong Rules</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">
            The <strong>Apriori Algorithm</strong> is one of the most widely used techniques for mining association rules. 
            It efficiently discovers frequent itemsets and derives strong rules using support, confidence, and lift measures.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="assets/Apriori_Algorithm.jpg" alt="Apriori Algorithm Process" class="topic-image">
        </div>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Breakdown of Apriori</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">
            The Apriori algorithm follows an iterative process to extract meaningful rules:
        </p>
        <ol class="fade-in">
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Scan the dataset and calculate support for each individual item.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove items that do not meet the minimum support threshold, eliminating infrequent patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Generate larger itemsets by combining frequent items and filter them based on the support threshold.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Extract association rules from the frequent itemsets and evaluate their confidence and lift values.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why is Apriori So Effective?</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">
            The Apriori algorithm is widely preferred for pattern recognition and association discovery due to its efficiency and scalability. 
            Key advantages include:
        </p>

        <ul class="fade-in">
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Can process large datasets efficiently by pruning irrelevant itemsets early.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-World Applications:</strong> Used in retail, finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics to detect behavioral patterns and anomalies.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Decision-Making:</strong> Helps businesses optimize product placement, inventory management, marketing campaigns, and targeted recommendations.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Data Preparation for Association Rule Mining (ARM) -->
        <h2>Data Preparation for Association Rule Mining</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">
            Association Rule Mining (ARM) requires data in a <strong>transactional format</strong>, where each row represents a set of items that frequently appear together. 
            Unlike supervised learning models, ARM does not rely on labeled data. Instead, it uncovers <strong>patterns and relationships</strong> based on item co-occurrences.
        </p>

        <h3>Raw Data Overview</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">
            The raw dataset consists of food items with attributes such as <strong>description, category, calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates</strong>. 
            However, this raw format is not directly usable for ARM since it contains <strong>numerical values and metadata</strong> that do not conform to a transaction-based structure.
        </p>

        <div class="image-section">
            <img src="assets/raw_data.jpeg" alt="Raw Data Preview" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 20px;">

            </a>
        </div>

        <h3>Data Processing Steps</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">
            To transform the raw dataset into a format suitable for ARM, we followed these structured steps:
        </p>
        <ul class="fade-in">
            <li><strong>Selected Relevant Columns:</strong> Removed unnecessary attributes such as brand names and retained only meaningful nutritional and categorical data.</li>
            <li><strong>Handled Missing Values:</strong> Filled missing values in <strong>numeric attributes with 0</strong> and categorical attributes with <strong>"Unknown"</strong> to prevent data loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Converted Numeric Values into Categories:</strong> Transformed <strong>calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrate</strong> values into labeled categories (e.g., "High-Fat", "Low-Carbs").</li>
            <li><strong>Formatted Data as Transactions:</strong> Removed the <strong>description column</strong> and combined the categorical attributes into a <strong>single transaction row</strong>, ensuring compatibility with ARM models.</li>
            <li><strong>Eliminated Duplicates:</strong> Removed redundant transactions to improve the accuracy of generated rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Saved Preprocessed Data:</strong> The cleaned dataset was stored as <strong>arm_prepared_data.csv</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

            After preparing the dataset, we applied <strong>Association Rule Mining (ARM)</strong> using the <strong>Apriori Algorithm</strong> to uncover meaningful relationships between food items.

        <h3>Applying the Apriori Algorithm</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">
            The Apriori Algorithm was implemented with the following parameters:
        </p>
        <ul class="fade-in">
            <li><strong>Support Threshold:</strong> 1% (Items appearing in at least 1% of transactions are considered frequent).</li>
            <li><strong>Confidence Threshold:</strong> 50% (Rules are generated only if they hold true at least 50% of the time).</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum Rule Length:</strong> 2 (Each rule must contain at least two items).</li>
        </ul>
