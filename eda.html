                    1. The analysis shows that 95.3% of the dataset is dominated by ultra-processed foods, highlighting their central role in modern diets and their contribution to the global health crisis. With their calorie-dense, nutrient-poor composition, ultra-processed foods are linked to rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses. This overwhelming dominance emphasizes the urgent need for accessible healthy alternatives, consumer education, and stricter regulations to promote a shift toward nutrient-rich, minimally processed diets for better health outcomes.

                    2. The analysis of average fat content by food category group reveals a stark contrast between sources of good fats and bad fats. Packaged snacks, categorized as bad fats, dominate the chart, highlighting their significantly high fat content. In contrast, dairy products and protein sources, which are good fat contributors, offer healthier alternatives with moderate fat levels. This disparity underscores the nutritional challenges posed by ultra-processed foods, which often have excessive unhealthy fat content compared to natural or minimally processed options. The findings emphasize the importance of promoting healthier food choices and reducing reliance on high-fat processed snacks to support better dietary habits and overall health.

The radar chart provides a comparative analysis of nutrient distributions across broad food categories, highlighting significant differences between healthy, minimally processed, and ultra-processed foods. Healthy categories, such as ‚ÄúHealthy - Protein,‚Äù show balanced levels of protein and lower concentrations of fats and carbs, aligning with nutritional guidelines. Conversely, ultra-processed categories like ‚ÄúSnacks‚Äù and ‚ÄúFast Food‚Äù exhibit elevated levels of fats and carbs, alongside reduced protein content, emphasizing their calorie-dense and nutrient-poor profiles. The ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category, exemplified by items like sauces and soups, demonstrates moderate nutrient variability, reinforcing its diverse nature. This visualization underscores the disparity in nutritional quality between food groups, illustrating how ultra-processed foods contribute disproportionately to caloric intake while offering limited nutritional value.

Ultra-processed foods, represented in various shades of red, dominate the lower protein range while exhibiting high caloric content. In contrast, minimally processed foods (light blue) and healthy protein-rich options (dark blue) show higher protein levels relative to their caloric content, indicating a more balanced nutritional profile. This distinction underscores the nutritional disparity between ultra-processed and healthier food options, highlighting the potential role of minimally and unprocessed foods in promoting better dietary choices.

                    7. The donut chart reveals that ultra-processed foods are predominantly represented by categories like soda (23.9%), cookies and biscuits (20.6%), ice cream and frozen yogurt (19%), and candy (17%). These categories, which are typically high in sugar, unhealthy fats, and additives, constitute the majority of ultra-processed food consumption. Such dominance of sugary beverages and snacks highlights their significant contribution to the global health crisis, as these foods are linked to obesity, diabetes, and other lifestyle-related diseases. Addressing the overconsumption of these specific categories is critical for mitigating health risks associated with ultra-processed foods.
